# wokwi-pca9535

This is my first try to make a Custom chip for Wokwi. 

[Preview in the web simulator](https://wokwi.com/projects/401153784260252673)
[Custom chips API documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/chips-api/getting-started)

Note: 
Still not sure how it needs to be structured a custom chip to work when it's loaded from a repository.
Tried to put the pca9535.* in src/ folder or in root, but I still get a: _Loading chip_ when it's initialized in VSCODE.

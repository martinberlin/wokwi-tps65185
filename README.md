# wokwi-tps65185

This is my 2nd try to make a Custom chip for Wokwi. 

[Preview in the web simulator](https://wokwi.com/projects/401153784260252673)
[Custom chips API documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/chips-api/getting-started)

Note: 
In Order to add a Chip to your project, you need to download the **.wasm** file from the Github repository actions.
As a second step, place this files in the **chips/** directory:

   - chipname.wasm
   - chipname.json

Only then you can add it in your diagram (Schematic) otherwise it won't appear. What I still do not know how to do is to load it from a external repository.
